                This is the postcolonial cognitive dissonance. I&apos;m physically in India, which used to be a former colony of the English. Colonization is an irreversible process, which is what I&apos;m accepting. A systemic erosion of resources of a land, only leaving a corroded system left to be in constant political instability. In India, English is the currency and capital, and I accept it. The colonizer could be only confronted with the colonizer&apos;s language. When I travel across India, the more I see the colonial remnants, and it is sad. Around the turn of adolescence I got exposed to rock music, which I clung to for trauma release, and naturally the music became part of my DNA. The strong relation I formed with the soul of David Gilmour and how I lately matched with the frequency of George Harrison. The land of Surrey, which I considered a &quot;holy land&quot; where the musicians like Eric Clapton and Roger Waters channeled the ambience of the English countryside. What is 1947? It is just an illusion. The more I live in India, the cognitive dissonance is heavy. My soul is deeply drawn to the land of the music that is in my DNA. When I was cycling in the morning, I thought of George Harrison&apos;s spirit, with which I&apos;m possessed. It could be a pipe dream or delusion, but that&apos;s me.

                At the age of near 26, I finally crushed my stupid dumb ego by starting carnatic vocal training. I had never been trained before even though music is in my DNA. The first class itself was a massive surge of dopamine and spiritual rush. It took my soul many years to dissolve its ego. As my energies are moving up towards the Third Eye Chakra (Ajna), the universe is shifting and the ego is dissolving.

                The music of the soul is evolving into truth. I&apos;m more attuned to Beatles, Stones and George Harrison these days. The lush and crisp voices created by the vibrations of an acoustic guitar paired with a soulful voice is more than enough for intimate soulful experience. Simple is better and to just let things go. My cognitive biases are dissolving as I just see everything as energy, frequency and vibration.

                I&apos;m awaiting to launch my YT channel and want to pour my heart and soul to it. I&apos;ll launch it when I really feel like the time is right. Universe is right. Inshallah. Om Namah Shivaya.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is extremely egoistic and stupid to disrespect music by doing stage shows without rigid training. I&apos;m grateful that I realized about the ego-trap at 26. Who knows if I&apos;ll join the 27 club? Haha. Life is short.

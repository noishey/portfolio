I'm passing through an intense psychedelic cleansing and deconditioning myself and healing from childhood traumas of parental neglect. Why should I be a "man," just because I was born into the body of a man? The soul has no gender, no race, and no religion other than being the soul. The soul is pure; it is the structures built to destroy the soul that should be eradicated.`

const p2 = `As a person who is exploring themselves, I realized that I'm also a huge victim of the patriarchal male gaze. I went too far and forced patriarchy into my soul only for it to bounce off my soul. Women are the worst patriarchs. It is not an individual I mustn't hate; it is patriarchy and all the other colonial forces.`

It is very attractive from a distance. I'm unlearning the hate in me, the racism, the sexism, and all the emotions that harm my heart and throat chakra. The true inner voice or the soul is eternal. It works in a higher dimension than food and sex. Let the woman speak. She is inside you. It is better to go in silence than to speak untruthful things.`

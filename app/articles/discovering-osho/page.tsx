                Osho says that knowing is not a destination but the expansion of consciousness; it is a journey. This mystic and godman has certainly taken away my attention through his avant-garde futuristic aesthetic and the magnificent and formidable aura. Osho is beyond words, as he is multidimensional. Osho is a direction, an energy, and a vibe. He has the Kalkiesque energy; I have coined that term. The youth need a spiritual purpose in this dooming world, and this energy definitely moves towards that.

                The energy is that of warm hands of protective uplifting vibrations, which are intense ripples passing through the soul body. There is no room for paranormality but a laser-focused path towards superconsciousness. I&apos;m volunteering as a young saadhak (seer) in an obscure and enchanted tapobhumi (meditative land) near a highway and miles away from the city of Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.

                My internet access is slow and unstable, which is not at all triggering me, as it is a sign to move offline and hug the trees around, connect with the nature. To burn the harmful layers that are creating a disconnect between the above and below.

                Osho unlocked many dimensions of reality, especially regarding art. He says there are two types of art: one is subjective and the other is objective. Subjective art, in short, is a result of anguish, and objective art is rooted in beauty and the submission of ego, for example, the monument of the{" "}

                I&apos;m naturally spreading OSHO&apos;s light to people who could tune in to his frequency. OSHO is not for a weak-spirited person; he is the so-called &quot;rich man&apos;s guru.&quot; He had a collection of Rolls-Royces inside Rajneeshpuram as an object of attraction so that he could spread his light to the devotees. A psychological trick.

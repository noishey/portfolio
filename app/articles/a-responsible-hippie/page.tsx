                In the book &apos;Zahir&apos; by Paulo Coelho, there is a scene where the protagonist, who happens to be a writer, has a debatable conversation with the homeless &quot;hippies&quot; in the streets of Paris. The debate is regarding the &quot;hippie&quot; arguing about their freedom of choice of being irresponsible and contributing nothing to society and being in their bubble of libertarianism. Around two years ago I had embraced the &quot;hippie&quot; life for a short time of a few months in Arambol, Goa. It was ecstatic at first, but because evading the inner traumas and money leaves a cognitive scar on the soul, it was grueling. Haha. I was chasing &quot;hippie chicks&quot; only to be disappointed, as it is all an illusive transitory liminal space.

                The purpose of this article is to redefine the definition of a hippie to me and others who have reached the word that I&apos;m writing. &quot;Hippie&quot; is a short form for &quot;hipster,&quot; an unconventional counter-cultural human being. Hippies could be rich too, like the singer Zaz, who has the aesthetics of a rich hippie, and that is far better than being a delusional lost nomad hippie. I&apos;m a hipster before anything. Living in the 70&apos;s rock and roll era, smoking pot (edibles now) and too much Hendrix. Living like this in 2020&apos;s India comes with a trade, a form of alienation from the masses, which I&apos;m finally and fully accepting. I&apos;m a mystic outlaw, and some are tuned into this state. Listening to the heart without guardrails is harming the heart in the long run, as is listening to it with a focus, e.g., Mount Kailash is my focal point, and God is before taking away heartfelt action. I ask Lord Shiva, is this right? And I get an answer. Shiva is a symbol of the masculine energy and Shakti (the divine feminine—Kodungaloor Amma).

                It is wise to live in a commune of liberals and free-spirited individuals to cut the noise of society. A society that is extremely harmful to my energy and liberal creative flow and liberation in sexuality.

                A responsible hippie is rich enough to take care of themselves and create money for the betterment of the community also. That&apos;s the lesson. Ciao.

              Witches vs Patriarchy

              There are only two sides one could pick: either that of the witch or that of the dreaded patriarchy.

                There are only two sides one could pick: either that of the witch or that of the dreaded patriarchy. The former moves towards nurturing, love, peace, harmony, inner truth, spiritual healing, and prosperity, and the latter goes towards anger, power, destruction, darkness, and wars. I went through the biggest transformation of my life these past months as I got into wellness, or in other words, I listened to me, the witch, the witch who had been silenced from the time of Eve. To all the witches who had been burnt have left a karmic debt to the rest of humanity. The more I cultivate my awareness and heal from my trauma, the more I can feel the collective feminine and the amount of darkness that is in the world, and it is sad that dark times are ahead and the only light should come from our hearts through love. Make Art. Write. Paint. Make music and express yourself; have liberty. If it is not outward, then have inward liberty. Meditate. Feel the Life Force.🙏
